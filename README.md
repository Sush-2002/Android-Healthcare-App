Android Healthcare App
I made this project using Java and SQLite Dtabase where this app deals with booking doctor appointment, to add item i.e, medicines and appointments in the cart then saving individual's preferences.
It also includes features like doctor details, buy medicine and so on and it uses java as main language to provide functionality to this app whereas SQLite database is used to store the data and user details into user's
own local device.
